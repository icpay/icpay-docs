# icpay SDKs

<Libraries />

## JavaScript SDK

Our JavaScript SDK is built with modern JavaScript features and provides a clean, promise-based API. It's perfect for Node.js applications and modern web browsers.

```bash
npm install @example/icpay-api --save
```

```javascript
import ApiClient from '@example/icpay-api'

const client = new ApiClient('your_api_key')
const conversations = await client.conversations.list()
```

## Python SDK

Our Python SDK is designed to be Pythonic and follows PEP 8 conventions. It's great for data processing, automation scripts, and web applications.

```bash
pip install icpay_api
```

```python
from icpay_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient('your_api_key')
conversations = client.conversations.list()
```

## PHP SDK

Our PHP SDK is built with modern PHP practices and provides a clean, object-oriented interface. It's perfect for Laravel, Symfony, and other PHP frameworks.

```bash
composer require icpay/sdk
```

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Icpay\ApiClient('your_api_key');
$conversations = $client->conversations->list();
```

## Ruby SDK

Our Ruby SDK follows Ruby conventions and provides a clean, readable interface. It's great for Rails applications and Ruby scripts.

```bash
gem install icpay_api
```

```ruby
require 'icpay_api'

client = IcpayApi::Client.new('your_api_key')
conversations = client.conversations.list
```

## Go SDK

Our Go SDK is designed for performance and follows Go best practices. It's perfect for microservices, CLI tools, and high-performance applications.

```bash
go get github.com/example/icpay-go
```

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/example/icpay-go"
)

func main() {
    client := icpay.NewClient("your_api_key")
    conversations, _ := client.Conversations.List()
}
```

## Getting started

To get started with any of our SDKs, you'll need your API key from the [icpay dashboard](#). Once you have that, you can install the SDK and start making API calls.
