# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the icpay API. We will cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We will also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of the icpay API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Get your API key

Before you can make requests to the icpay API, you will need to grab your [API key from the icpay dashboard](#). This key is used to authenticate your requests and identify your application to the icpay API.

## Choose your API client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good old cURL HTTP requests, icpay offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

### JavaScript

```bash
# Install the icpay JavaScript SDK
npm install @example/icpay-api --save
```

### Python

```bash
# Install the icpay Python SDK
pip install icpay_api
```

### PHP

```bash
# Install the icpay PHP SDK
composer require icpay/sdk
```

## Make your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the icpay API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default limit.

### cURL

```bash {{ title: 'Get conversations with cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.icpay.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your_api_key}" \
  -d limit=10
```

### JavaScript

```javascript {{ title: 'Get conversations with JavaScript' }}
import ApiClient from '@example/icpay-api'

const client = new ApiClient('{your_api_key}')
const conversations = await client.conversations.list({ limit: 10 })
```

### Python

```python {{ title: 'Get conversations with Python' }}
from icpay_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient('{your_api_key}')
conversations = client.conversations.list(limit=10)
```

### PHP

```php {{ title: 'Get conversations with PHP' }}
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Icpay\ApiClient($token);
$conversations = $client->conversations->list(['limit' => 10]);
```
