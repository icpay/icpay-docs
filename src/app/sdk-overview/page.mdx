# ICPay SDK Overview

The ICPay SDK ships as a single package that supports two usage modes. Use the public SDK on the frontend with your Publishable Key; use the private SDK on the server with your Secret Key. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What is the SDK?

- One npm package: `@ic-pay/icpay-sdk`.
- Public methods are safe for client apps and do not require your Secret Key.
- Private methods live under `icpay.protected.*` and require your Secret Key; they must only be used server-side.

## Public SDK (frontend)

- Initialize with `publishableKey`.
- Typical tasks: get verified tokens, resolve canister IDs, price calculation, and initiate payments from the user’s wallet via `createPayment`/`createPaymentUsd` (requires wallet + actor provider).
- See: [Public SDK guide](/sdk)

## Private SDK (server)

- Initialize with `secretKey`.
- Typical tasks: account details, payment history, transactions, tokens with prices for your account, webhook event lookups, etc.
- Exposed via `icpay.protected.*` methods.
- See: [Private SDK (server)](/sdk-secret)

## When to use which

- Use the Public SDK in browsers to let users pay from their own wallets. Never embed the Secret Key in client apps.
- Use the Private SDK on your server or serverless functions to manage your account data securely with the Secret Key.
