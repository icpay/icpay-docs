# Widget Overview

The ICPay Widget is a set of Web Components that let you accept payments quickly without building UI flows from scratch. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What is the Widget?

- Framework-agnostic Web Components (`icpay-*`) powered by the ICPay SDK.
- Built-in wallet handling via Plug N Play (optional) or bring-your-own wallet (`actorProvider`, `connectedWallet`).

## When to use

- You want to embed a payment UI (tips, premium content, donation thermometer, shop items) with minimal setup.
- You prefer declarative configuration via element `config`.

## Relation to SDK

- The widget wraps the [Public SDK](/sdk) and passes supported options through.
- Server-only operations still belong on your backend using the [Private SDK](/sdk-secret).
