# Tokens (Shortcodes)

Shortcodes are the primary way to reference tokens in ICPay. Each verified token ledger exposes a unique, human‑readable `shortcode` (for example, `ic_icp`, `base_usdc`). Use these in SDK and Widget calls instead of raw symbols, canister IDs, or contract addresses where possible. {{ className: 'lead' }}

> Tip: You can also explore token availability via the Widget Builder, but this page provides a quick, scannable reference.

## Overview

- **Shortcode**: Canonical identifier used across ICPay SDK and Widgets.
- **Contract / Canister**: Token contract (EVM/Solana) or canister (IC).
- **Verified**: Indicates whether the token is verified in ICPay.

This list updates periodically and is grouped by chain. If you don’t see a token you expect, check back later or use the Widget Builder to search interactively.
